# Dashboard Assessment

Important points:
1. The answers to the questions are inside the pdf named "Data Visualization Engineer Assessment" in the "Answers" header.
2. The tooltip shows a % comparison, this is always with the week previous to the point selected.
3. Original data was used, however I created an aggregated file with the information contained in the original to optimize performance.
